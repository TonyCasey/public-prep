"The missing piece in interview preparation"
After working with an excellent interview coach who gave me invaluable strategic advice, I realized there was still a gap in my preparation. I needed somewhere to practice my STAR method answers repeatedly without taking up more of my coach's valuable time.
The Challenge I Identified
Even with professional coaching guidance, I found myself wanting unlimited practice opportunities. The STAR method made sense conceptually, but I needed to rehearse my examples until they became natural and confident.
The insight: Great coaches provide strategy, confidence, and personalized guidance. But candidates also need a safe space for unlimited practice between coaching sessions.
So I Built the Practice Platform I Wished Existed
Public Prep fills the gap between coaching sessions - giving candidates unlimited practice opportunities so they can arrive at their next coaching session more prepared and confident.
The platform combines AI technology with deep knowledge of the Irish public service competency framework to provide instant practice feedback.
Result: Candidates can practice relentlessly, then use their coaching time for strategic guidance and confidence building rather than basic STAR method repetition.
